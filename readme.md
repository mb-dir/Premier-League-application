# Premier League application

Simple application which shows basic information about Premier League clubs like stadion, date of creation, current players, etc.

## Motivation

I like watching football a lot. My most favorite football league is Premier League, so I have searched API which can give me necessary data, and I have started to create the application. I am very interesting of the results of my work ;).

## What I use?

The API which I use is a free, and [here it is](https://www.football-data.org/). In additional I  use [webpack starter kit](https://github.com/maciejkorsan/wtf-webpack-starter) created by [Maciej Korsan](https://www.facebook.com/korsanpl/).

## How to use it?
